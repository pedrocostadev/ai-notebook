## 2026-01-10 - Persist Chat Selection

- Implemented localStorage persistence for selectedPdfId and selectedChapterId
- Added validation on load to clear invalid selections (deleted PDFs/chapters)
- Files changed: `src/renderer/src/hooks/usePdfs.ts`
- **Learnings:**
  - Followed existing pattern for expandedPdfIds localStorage persistence
  - Validation effect runs after loading=false to avoid premature clearing
  - TypeScript passes, tests blocked by environment issue (Linux/Mac Electron binary mismatch)
