## 2026-01-08 - Follow-up Questions Buttons

- What was implemented:
  - Converted follow-up questions from a simple bulleted list to clickable buttons
  - Added `onFollowUpClick` callback prop to `MessageList` component
  - Styled buttons with pill/chip design using Tailwind (rounded-full, primary colors with transparency)
  - Wired up ChatContainer to pass `sendMessage` as the click handler
  - Clicking a follow-up question now sends it as a new user message

- Files changed:
  - `src/renderer/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx` - Added prop, replaced `<li>` with `<button>` elements
  - `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` - Passed `onFollowUpClick={sendMessage}` prop

- **Learnings:**
  - The `sendMessage` function from `useChat` hook handles optimistic UI updates automatically
  - The optional chaining `onFollowUpClick?.(q)` pattern is clean for optional callbacks
  - Follow-up questions were already stored in `message.metadata.followUpQuestions` array
  - Using `text-left` on buttons ensures longer questions wrap properly

## 2026-01-08 - Empty Chat Illustration

- What was implemented:
  - Added empty state display when chat has no messages
  - Used `MessageSquareText` icon from lucide-react as visual illustration
  - Added helpful text prompting user to start conversation or use slash commands
  - Empty state shows only when: no messages, not streaming, no command loading

- Files changed:
  - `src/renderer/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx` - Added isEmpty check and empty state UI

- **Learnings:**
  - The ternary conditional inside JSX requires careful bracket/parenthesis matching
  - Reusing the same icon styling pattern (h-16 w-16 opacity-20) as "No PDF Selected" keeps consistency
  - Using `py-16` instead of `h-full` works better for centering in ScrollArea contexts
